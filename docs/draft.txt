                           The RecipeJSON Format

Abstract

   RecipeJSON is a recipe data interchange format based on JavaScript
   Object Notation (JSON).  It defines a type of JSON objects and
   the manner in which they are combined to represent data about
   recipes features, their properties, and their spatial extents.

Status of This Memo

   This is currently in the experimental stage and very much subject to change.
   This first draft was created from the 20.07.2017 to the 22.07.2017 at the "Code Kombüse" Hackathon and 
   is my first formal definition, so don't hit me for it.
